# Graduate Research Life

<!-- <br> -->

If you've stubled onto this page, chances are that you've recently embarked on your graduate research programme or are somewhere along in your research studies! For this, I applaud your ambition and zeal!

You'll rarely, if ever, find two identical PhD experiences. But the uncertainty that comes along with it, especially early on, is nearly omnipresent.

The wonderful people at University of Melbourne's Faculty of Business & Economics have provided a very useful and succinct <a href="https://library.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/1924120/Completing_a_PhD.pdf" target="_blank">guide</a>  to what a PhD entails. Here's a clip to give you a greater sense of what to expect throughout a PhD, keeping in mind that no two PhD experiences are alike.

# The Research Checklist

#### The Thesis Checklist

I've always been a fan of to-do lists and checklists to keep me on task. This ~~obsession~~ liking only intensified after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto#:~:text=The%20Checklist%20Manifesto%3A%20How%20to,of%20daily%20and%20professional%20life." target="_blank">The Checklist Manifesto</a> by Atul Gawande. Unsurprisingly, a checklist of key PhD milestones appealed greatly to me.

# Structuring/Simplifying the Research Process 

#### An evidence-based approach - Pitching Research (PR)

<a href="http://pitchingresearch.com/index.html" target="_blank">Pitching Research</a> is a template tool, developed by Professor Robert Faff from the UQ Business School, designed to help exchange ideas between novice researchers and their academic advisors. The PR template provides researchers with a structured framework to position their research. Here's a primer to the methodology.

The tool can also be reverse engineered to take an existing research paper and de-construct it back into the ‘Pitching Research’ Framework. In it’s ‘Reverse Engineering’ form, ‘Pitching Research’ provides a succinct and adaptable framework for all students at all levels of study, to collect, evaluate and communicate the essential elements of an existing research article or new research idea.

# Writing

Here we have James Hayton, of 3 Month Thesis fame, providing great tips on the overall process of PhD thesis writing.

# Project Updates 

#### Meetings

You'll be having plenty of meetings with your supervisor(s) and/or collaborators. However, for meetings to be timely and productive, an agenda is highly recommended. Here's a great example of an agenda from HBR:

<a href="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/03/W150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA-1-751x1024.png"><img src="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/03/W150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA-1-751x1024.png" alt="Sample meeting agenda" border="0"></a><figcaption>Source: https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-design-an-agenda-for-an-effective-meeting</figcaption><br />


Minute taking during these meetings can help synthesize action points and act as a future reference on decisions made. Evernote has got a great template for capturing meeting notes:
