# Graduate Research Life

<!-- <br> -->

If you've stubled onto this page, chances are that you've recently embarked on your graduate research programme or are somewhere along in your research studies! For this, I applaud your ambition and zeal!

You'll rarely, if ever, find two identical PhD experiences. But the uncertainty that comes along with it, especially early on, is nearly omnipresent.

The wonderful people at University of Melbourne's Faculty of Business & Economics have provided a very useful and succinct guide to what a PhD [entails](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/1924120/Completing_a_PhD.pdf). Here's a clip to give you a greater sense of what to expect throughout a PhD, keeping in mind that no two PhD experiences are alike.

#### Meetings

You'll be having plenty of meetings with your supervisor(s) and/or collaborators. However, for meetings to be timely and productive, an agenda is highly recommended. Here's a great example of an agenda from HBR:

<a href="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/03/W150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA-1-751x1024.png"><img src="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/03/W150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA-1-751x1024.png" alt="Sample meeting agenda" border="0"></a><figcaption>Source: https://hbr.org/2015/03/how-to-design-an-agenda-for-an-effective-meeting</figcaption><br />


Minute taking during these meetings can help synthesize action points and act as a future reference on decisions made. Evernote has got a great template for capturing meeting notes:
